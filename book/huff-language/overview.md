# Huff by Example

## Introduction

Huff by Example is an effort to provide a thorough explanation of each
feature of the Huff language, along with code-snippet examples detailing how,
when, where, and why to use each one. The snippets here are heavily 
commentated, but this section does assume some prior experience working 
with the EVM.

If you are new to low-level EVM programming, please read the
[Tutorials](../tutorial/overview.md) section of the docs before diving into
Huff development. If you run into any issues, please feel free to come ask
the community questions on [Telegram](https://t.me/huff_neo).
